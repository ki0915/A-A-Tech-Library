In this article, I will introduce the basic areas of security.

> Offensive Security

<span style="color: red">Offensive security</span> involves the process of finding vulnerabilities in applications to infiltrate computer systems, exploit software bugs, and gain unauthorized access to applications.

In short, it means acting like a <span style="color: red">“hacker”</span> to stop hackers.

This concept is similar to the image we have of hackers.

> Defensive Security

Defensive security differs somewhat from offensive security because it involves two main tasks.

    <h3>Defensive Security Domain</h3>
    <p>This document explains two key topics related to defensive security: <span class="highlight">SOC handling threat intelligence</span> and <span class="highlight">DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response)</span>.</p>
    <div class="section">
        <h4>SOC (Security Operation Center)</h2>
        <p>The SOC plays a central role in maintaining the security of an organization, detecting, analyzing, and responding to threats. The SOC uses security devices and technologies to monitor the network in real-time, identify potential threats, and address them quickly.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Threat Intelligence</strong>: The SOC uses Threat Intelligence to gather and analyze information on new threats and vulnerabilities. This intelligence is crucial for improving security policies and preparing defenses against threats.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Monitoring</strong>: The SOC team monitors networks, systems, and applications in real-time to detect suspicious activities and investigate them promptly.</li>
            <li><strong>Incident Response</strong>: The SOC recognizes incidents quickly and minimizes threats through appropriate response procedures.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h4>DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response)</h4>
        <p>DFIR combines Digital Forensics and Incident Response, focusing on investigating and responding to security incidents within an organization. Malware analysis plays a crucial role in this process.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Digital Forensics</strong>: Digital Forensics within DFIR involves collecting and analyzing evidence after a security incident to determine the cause and impact of the attack.</li>
            <li><strong>Incident Response</strong>: Incident response involves the quick handling and recovery process following a security incident. The goal is to minimize damage and take preventive measures to avoid similar incidents in the future.</li>
            <li><strong>Malware Analysis</strong>: Malware analysis is a significant part of DFIR, focusing on understanding the behavior and structure of malicious software to identify the attacker’s intent and strategy. This helps in formulating response strategies and strengthening security systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Incident Response</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Preparation</strong>: A prepared and trained team is essential to handle incidents. Ideally, various measures should be taken to prevent incidents from occurring in the first place.</li>
            <li><strong>Detection and Analysis</strong>: The team should have the necessary resources to detect incidents and further analyze the detected events to assess their severity.</li>
            <li><strong>Containment, Eradication, and Recovery</strong>: Once an incident is detected, it is crucial to stop it from spreading to other systems, eradicate the threat, and ensure the affected systems are restored. For example, if a system is infected with a virus, containment would involve preventing the virus from spreading to other systems, eradication would involve treating the virus, and recovery would ensure proper system restoration.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Incident Activity</strong>: After a successful recovery, a report is generated, and lessons learned are shared to prevent similar incidents in the future.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
  
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Malware Analysis</h3>
        <p>Malware refers to malicious software, including programs, documents, and files that can be stored on a disk or transmitted over a network. There are various types of malware, and the main types include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Virus</strong>: A virus is a piece of code (a part of a program) that attaches itself to a program. It is designed to spread from one computer to another and can modify, overwrite, and delete files on the infected computer. The results can range from slowing down the computer to rendering it unusable.</li>
            <li><strong>Trojan Horse</strong>: A Trojan horse is a program that appears to perform a desirable function but actually performs malicious activities. It can create a backdoor in the system, allowing unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>Worm</strong>: Unlike viruses, worms do not require a host program and can spread autonomously. They often exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems or applications to replicate and spread across networks.</li>
            <li><strong>Ransomware</strong>: Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the victim’s files and demands a ransom for the decryption key. It can cause significant damage to organizations and individuals.</li>
        </ul>
