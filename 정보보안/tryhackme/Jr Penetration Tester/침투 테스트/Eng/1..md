Here is the English translation of your text with the specified formatting:

**"A penetration test is an **authorized audit** of the security and defenses of a computer system, which the system owner has agreed to. In this sense, it has the legitimacy of penetration, but it must not exceed the agreed-upon scope.**

<span style="color: red">Exceeding this scope would turn the test into hacking.</span>

            </tr>

        <h2>Rules of Engagement (ROE)</h2>

        <p>ROE is a document created at the early stages of a penetration testing contract.</p>

                <td>Rules</td>

        <h2>Penetration Testing Methodology</h2>

        <p>Penetration testing can have various objectives and goals within its scope. Therefore, penetration tests are not all the same, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to how penetration testers should proceed.</p>
        
        <p>The steps performed by a penetration tester during an engagement are referred to as the <span class="highlight">methodology</span>. A practical methodology involves actions taken in a smart way that are relevant to the current situation. Each situation may require a different methodology. For example, the methodology used to test the security of a web application may not be practical when testing the security of a network, as these are different domains.</p>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Information Gathering</td>
                <td>In this step, as much information as possible is collected about the target/organization from publicly accessible sources (e.g., OSINT and research).<br><small>Note: This does not include system scanning.</small></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Enumeration/Scanning</td>
                <td>This step involves discovering applications and services running on the system. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable. Example: Finding a port with a vulnerable service running.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Exploitation</td>
                <td>This step involves exploiting the vulnerabilities found in the system or application. This may involve using publicly available exploits or exploiting application logic. Think of it as the stage where direct attacks are carried out.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Privilege Escalation</td>
                <td>After successfully exploiting a system or application, this step attempts to elevate the privileges on the system. Privilege escalation can be horizontal or vertical. It can involve gaining higher privileges from the initial account or permissions, such as gaining administrator access.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Post-Exploitation</td>
                <td>This step includes several sub-steps:<br>
                    1. Finding other hosts that could be targets.<br>
                    2. What additional information can be gathered from the host now that higher privileges have been obtained?<br>
                    3. Deleting traces of the intrusion.<br>
                    4. Reporting.

        <p><strong>OSSTMM</strong>: The OSSTMM provides a detailed framework for testing strategies for systems, software, applications, communications, and the human aspect of cybersecurity.</p>
        <p>This methodology mainly focuses on how these systems and applications communicate, so it includes methodologies for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Communications (telephone, VoIP, etc.)</li>
            <li>Wired networks</li>
